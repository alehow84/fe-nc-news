# NC News ðŸ’¬

*Overview*

NC News is a CRUD web-app built during [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) Software Development Bootcamp November '23 to March '24

It is a News site with a social aspect, similar to Reddit, where users can:

- View a list of all available articles
- Sort all articles by Date, Comments and Votes
- Change the order of all articles (ascending or descending)
- Filter the articles by available article topics
- View a single article
- View a list of comments of a single article
- Post a comment to an article as the default logged in user
- Delete comments from the article that have been posted by the logged in user
- Up or down vote the article

If the user attempts to amend the /articles/ or /articles/topic/ urls with an article number or topic that is not found or compatible with the requirements of the API, they will see an error component displaying error information
